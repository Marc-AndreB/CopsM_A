\alias{plot.bottom.spectra}
\title{This function makes a plot of the upwelling and downwelling
irradiances at the deepest point of the cast. If the bottom
was reached (cops$SHALLOW = TRUE), then a plot of the
calculated bottom reflectance is generated above the initial
graph.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{bottom.spectra}(cops, SAVE = FALSE, MaxThreshold_Ed_Eu = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{SAVE}{is a binary parameter specifying whether the
generated plot should be saved. Plots are saved in the
bottom_spectra folder of the working directory. Make sure to
create this directory beforehand.}

\item{fullpath}{is the path from the working directory to
the .RData file of the cast}
